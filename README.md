Hello grader! 

- Find all the related challenge work in the main branch of this repository
 - IMPORTANT NOTE: it seems that count_documents was not working, and I wasn't able to update pymongo to the correct version to make it work (even the latest). I added the code using it in the comment section and got the results via forloops, please let me know if there are any issues!
